    "So far, only the use of first-order derivatives has been discussed in this chapter. However, the process with first-order derivatives can be slow with some error surfaces. The problem is caused by the nature of <font color='red'>curvature</font> (i.e., <font color='blue'>second-order derivatives</font>, <font color='orange'>changing gradient</font>), where the first-order gradient does not contain the information needed to control the size of the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>In general, second-order methods approximate the local loss surface with a quadratic bowl, which is more accurate than the linear approximation.</font> Some second-order methods like the *Newton-methods* require exactly one iteration in order to find the local optimal solution for a quadratic surface. Of course, the loss surface of neural method is typically not quadratic. Nevertheless, the approximation is often good enough that gradient-descent methods are **greatly accelerated** at least in cases where the change in the gradient is not too sudden or drastic.\n",

    "## Quadratic approximation and Newton update\n",
    "One can write a quadratic approximation of the loss function in the vicinity of parameter vector $W_0$ by using the following Taylor expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(W) \\approx L(W_0) + (W-W_0)^T[\\nabla L(W_0)]+\\frac{1}{2}(W-W_0)^T H (W- W_0)$$\n",

    "- $W$ is the vincinity of $W_0$.\n",
    "- $\\nabla L(W_0)$ is the gradient computed at $W_0$.\n",
    "- $H$ is the Hessian computed at $W_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quadratic loss function, the loss surface is a bowl, and we can use the Newton update to reach the bottom of the bowl in a single step.\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\nabla L(W^*) &= \\nabla \\Big\\{ L(W_0) + (W^*-W_0)^T[\\nabla L(W_0)]+\\frac{1}{2}(W^*-W_0)^T H (W^*- W_0) \\Big\\}\\\\\n",

    "However, in most cases, the loss function is more complicated, so that Newton method without learning rate can easily lead to gradient explosion, which does not meet our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvement from first-order to second-order\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing to the steepest-gradient descent, the second-order method (Newton update) premultiplies the gradient with the inverse of the Hessian. This premultiplication plays a key role in changing the direction of the steepest-graident towards low-curvature directions, because the Hessain matrix comprises the changing rate of every directions for each element in the gradient. This property can greatly accelerate the learning procedure and keep it from suffering oscillation in valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the learning rate is already incorporated into the Hessian matrix implicitly, so that we don't need to determine the learning rate during the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "In most large-scale neural network settings, the Hessian is too large to store or compute explicitly. It is not uncommon to have neural networks with millions of parameters. Trying to compute the inverse of a $10^6\\times 10^6$ Hessian matrix is impractical with the computational power today. In fact, it is difficult to even compute the Hessian, let alone invert it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, many approximations and variations of the Newton method have been developed.\n",

    "# Line search along eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "An intuitive perspective for finding the optimum vector of the bowl given by a Hessian is to make the best (projected) gradient-descent step along each eigenvector so as to minimize the loss function. The best movement along a particular diretion is done using line search to select the step size.\n",
